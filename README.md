## 🚀 Startup Idea – Why StreetR?

StreetR is built from a **real-world problem** I observed every day.

People struggle to:
- Find nearby street services quickly
- Know who is available right now
- Connect without confusion or delay

Street vendors struggle with:
- No digital visibility
- No stable customer flow
- No technology support

👉 **StreetR solves this by creating a direct digital bridge between customers and street service providers.**
